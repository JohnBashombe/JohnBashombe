## 🛠️ My Skills

🚀 I have extensive experience in <b>TypeScript, JavaScript Java and PHP</b>, to name a few. I am also trained in <b>Solutions Architecture, Data Science, and Agile methodologies</b>. 
I usually work on a variety of projects and cover all domains. On one hand, you will have web-based apps, on the other hand perhaps you need to write the logic for your application or connect a third-party service to it.
I will be doing all the programming related to the project. It could be anything from Blogging, creating a back-end example website, Admin dashboard, and other tweaks to make the project work out properly.

These are the tools I normally use while working on a particular product.
