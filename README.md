## 🛠️ My Skills

🚀 I have extensive experience in TypeScript, JavaScript Java and PHP, to name a few. I am also trained in Solutions Architecture, Data Science and Agile methodologies. 
I usually work on a variety of projects and cover all domains. On one hand you will have web-based apps, on the other hand perhaps you need to write logic for your application or connect a third party service to it.
I will be doing all the programming related to the project. It could be anything from Blogging, creating back-end example website, Admin dashboard and other tweaks to make the project work out properly.

These are the tools I normally use while working on a product.
