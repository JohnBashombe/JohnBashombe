  I'm a software developer, <br/> 
  I enjoy challenging and technically interesting software development.
  I love building anything from small side projects to complex themes and intents. My one interest is in improving myself. I get excited about creating beautiful, functional, and fun products. <br/>
  I'm a skilled and efficient software engineer who has built a variety of web applications on several platforms. I'm driven to create things that solve practical problems. I can work autonomously and collaborate with other developers to bring your projects to life.
  I have a passion for exploring new ideas and ways of doing things. This has manifested itself in my desire to learn new programming languages, technology stacks and software development practices. <br/>
  I've been working with programming and software development for more than 4 years. I've worked on large digital products and on small web applications. I specialize in mobile and web app development, as well as in design and UX and Forex Trading.
